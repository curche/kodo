# General

### **Will there be an iOS version?**

No. There is no iOS version, and there are no plans for one. Since iOS and Android apps do not share code, it is hard to port.

### **Will Tachiyomi ever be on the Google Play Store?**

Google Play's content policy does not allow the APK based extension system to work. The content on some websites will lead to Google taking it down at some point, and Inorichi does not want to have to deal with it as they have stated [before](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi/issues/1745#issuecomment-441208074).

To report Tachiyomi copycats on the Google Play Store, you can fill out [this form](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/takedown) following [these steps](https://pastebin.com/08eeuJxH).

### **How do I migrate from the F-Droid version?**

Tachiyomi on F-Droid is not officially supported, so updates are not guaranteed. If you want to migrate to the official builds:

1. Create a backup.
2. Uninstall the F-Droid version (do not keep any app data if it allows you to).
3. Download and install Tachiyomi.
4. Restore your backup.

We have no intention to host our own F-Droid repo since Tachiyomi already manages updates by itself, making the usage of F-Droid redundant. For more detailed info, see [this GitHub comment](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi/issues/6736#issuecomment-1059608058).

### **Can Tachiyomi read light novels?**

No. Tachiyomi is an image parser, not a text parser.

**Can Tachiyomi stream anime?**

No. Any project that calls itself Tachiyomi that supports anime is **not affiliated with the main project**.

### **Can Tachiyomi sync between devices?**

No. But you can use Tachiyomi backup and restore features to save and load manga database and move manga content to another device.
