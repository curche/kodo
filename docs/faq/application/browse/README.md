### **How do I find a manga I am looking for?**

Sometimes you can struggle to find a source that has the manga you are looking to read. Here are some tips to help you find it:&#x20;

Tips to find your manga

1. Look up the manga on [Google](https://google.com/) or a manga database such as [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/).
2. See if the manga has any alternate spellings or other title variations. Try searching again in your sources with the alternate titles you found.
3. If you still cannot find the manga in any of your sources, then try to search for an extension for the website you found in step 1 in the extensions list.

**If you find the manga on a specific scanlator or aggregator and they do have an extension**

Download the corresponding extension, tap on it under → **Sources**, and then search for the manga there.

**If you find the manga on a specific scanlator or aggregator and they do not have an extension**

Check if adding the site as an extension has [already been requested](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues) and that it is not on the list of extensions that will not be added back [here](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues/3475). If it has not been requested and it is not on the list, you can [request it here](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues/new/choose).

If the scanlator or aggregator does not have an online manga reader, you can download the manga from their website and set up the series as a local manga.
