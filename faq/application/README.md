# Application

## **What is Tachiyomi Preview?**

It is a weekly updated, beta version of the app. It contains features that may be added to Tachiyomi in the future and is more prone to bugs and crashes. It is intended for users who would like the bleeding edge of Tachiyomi as soon as it comes out.

If you are willing to use Tachiyomi Preview, be sure to turn on auto-backup to prevent losing your library due to potential bugs or crashes.

## Updating the application

### **How do I enable automatic updates?**

From version **0.9.0** and onwards, Tachiyomi has had automatic updates for the app enabled by default. The **Preview** version also has automatic updates enabled by default.

However, if you think you are on an outdated version, go to **More** → **About** and tap on **Check for updates**.

### **Why are automatic updates not working?**

Certain Android skins like MIUI have very aggressive battery saving, which can kill the app in the background. To whitelist Tachiyomi from your battery saver, go to **More** → **Settings** → **Advanced** and tap on **Disable battery optimization**. If that does not work, you can also visit [DontKillMyApp](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) to see what battery saving options your device has and how to disable or circumvent them.

## Uninstalling the application

### **Why am I unable to uninstall Tachiyomi?**

On **Android 10**, a bug was introduced that prevented users from uninstalling the app if the device had a MicroSD card. To fix the issue, please remove the MicroSD card from the device first, then uninstall Tachiyomi.
