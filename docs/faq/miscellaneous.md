### **What is DNS over HTTPS?**

DNS over HTTPS is an experimental way of providing, as the name implies, DNS resolution via HTTPS. It provides the advantage of not being vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle attacks (due to TLS encryption in HTTPS), preventing DNS spoofing. If you would like to learn more, go [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dns-over-tls/). It allows some blocks to be circumvented without using a VPN.

You can enable this feature by going to **More** → **Settings** → **Advanced**.
