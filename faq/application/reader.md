# Reader

### **Why are some images not displayed?**

Aside from network issues, sometimes Tachiyomi does not register the image as existing, exit, and re-enter the reader to fix this.

### **Will there ever be a dual-page reader option?**

The logic required to make a dual-page reader automatically work along with scanlator page inconsistencies and other issues means it is unlikely to be added at this time.

**How can I make Tachiyomi turn pages with the volume rocker? Can I reverse the tapping direction? Can I change the tapping zones?**

Refer to the guides section of the site here. Refer to here if you want to use your volume rocker to navigate pages.
