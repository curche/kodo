# User Interface

### **Can I change the app language?**

No. It was removed due to it causing small bugs everywhere in **Tachiyomi**. Android does not provide a standard way of selecting a language that's not your device-language. You can improve the quality of the translations in your language [here](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tachiyomi/) or change your system language.
